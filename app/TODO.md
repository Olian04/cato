### Feedback from CCP Command Palette:
"I am so used to this feature in sublime that every other app that i use now i hit CTRL+SHIFT+P i just want a command palette to popup somewhere on the screen. Thank you so much for this.

Suggestions
1. Provide users with options to change font size
2. Dark Color Theme
3. Center Align of menu
4. Item list size or Page size."

an options page that previews your changes would be nice.

### Commander Review
"Upon remapping the activation hotkey to cmd+shift+p, I got exactly what I was looking for – an Atom-esque command palette for Chrome. Can't wait to start experimenting with custom actions and see how far I can go with those. Thanks for the work, Sriram. Much obliged :)"
